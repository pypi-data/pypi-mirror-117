Customization
===============

Although the built-in image model, along with the image processing views
demonstrated in the demo, might have met the basic needs for some apps,
advance users might require more features in terms of image storage,
permission control, template inheritance, and Image model (fields)
customization.

Before that, we need to address how this app is working.

Image model and views
----------------------

Until now, Django didn't supply any type of `Field` which can store unknown
length of images or files. However, the introduction of ``JsonField``
(since Django 3) made it possible workaround the issue by storing the ``pk``
of image model instances as a Json list in a custom ``JsonField``.

The first obstacle we met is: how to map the ``pks`` to the actual image model instances?
Our workaround is saving the
`app_label.model_name <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/applications/#django.apps.apps.get_model>`_
of the image model (which we called ``target_model`` throughout the app and docs)
in :class:`galleryfield.fields.GalleryField`.

Following that, there should be three basic views to handle image model instances,
before saving their ``pks`` to the ``GalleryField``:
Create (which we called **upload** operation),
List (which we called **fetch** operation)
and Update (which we mean **crop** operation).
The potential problems include: users will have to write 3 image handling views each time when
a new ``target_model`` is introduced for a new type of gallery/album,
is there any shortcut that we don't need to write much code to achieve that?
And, can a image model automatically know what default url name they should look for
(to find the views) when trying to do the 3 operations?
We finally introduced a class-based views for each operation, and
set a :ref:`naming rule <image_handling_url_naming_rule>` for the naming of the url names
for the 3 operations.

Therefore, a model level customization (for image model) involves:


.. _customize-valid-image-model:

A valid target image model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Image model is where we actually save the image uploaded. To be a valid target image model,
it need to meet one of the following 2 requirements:

1. It has a ``django.db.models.ImageField`` named ``image``.

2. It has a ``django.db.models.ImageField`` which not named ``image``
   but the field can be accessed by a ``classmethod`` named ``get_image_field``.
   For example, in an app named ``my_app``, we can have the following valid target image model in
   ``my_app.models.py``:

.. snippet:: python
   :filename: my_app/models.py

   class MyImage(models.Model):
        photo = models.ImageField(
            upload_to="my_images", storage=default_storage, verbose_name=_("Image"))
        creator = models.ForeignKey(
                settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, null=False, blank=False,
                        verbose_name=_('Creator'), on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        creation_time = models.DateTimeField(default=now(), blank=False)

        @classmethod
        def get_image_field(cls):
            return cls._meta.get_field("photo")

.. note:: In the example above, when defining the :meth:`get_image_field`,
   we can't simply ``return cls.photo`` because it
   returns a :class:`django.db.models.fields.files.ImageFieldFile`
   object instead of a :class:`django.db.models.ImageField` object.

The :class:`galleryfield.models.BuiltInGalleryImage` is using the first style (
with ``target_model="garllery_widget.BuiltInGalleryImage"``).
However, if you don't want to do much change to your existing models
(e.g., avoiding migrations of existing model),
the second style is more sounding.

In the following, we will use the above model in a :class:`galleryfield.fields.GalleryField`
with ``target_model = "my_app.MyImage"``.


Three views for handling the image model objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Three views for handling the image model objects (upload, fetch and crop). We provided 3
  class-based-views for these views to enable the built-in views.

  - :class:`galleryfield.image_views.ImageCreateView`
  - :class:`galleryfield.image_views.ImageListView`
  - :class:`galleryfield.image_views.ImageCropView`

  See :ref:`Built-in Image handling Views <built-in-image-views>` for more detail. We hope users can subclass
  the views above without much coding work. We think the 3 views
  handling built-in image model (i.e., :class:`galleryfield.image_views.BuiltInImageCreateView`,
  :class:`galleryfield.image_views.BuiltInImageListView` and
  :class:`galleryfield.image_views.BuiltInImageCropView` were good examples of how to used them.


.. _image_handling_url_naming_rule:

Naming rule for urls of image handling views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generally, the widget need to know the urls for image handling views (see :ref:`GalleryWidget docs <widget_docs>`).
We may specify the url name manually in gallery modelform fields widget configurations.
Alternatively, we can also let the widget infer what urls it should use for those views, by
following a naming rules for those views in ``URL_CONF``.
The default url names are the lower cased model_name, suffixed by ``-upload``, ``-fetch`` and ``-crop``,
respectively. For example, if you have a ``target_model`` named ``my_app.MyImage``, then the default
url names are ``myimage-upload``, ``myimage-fetch`` and ``myimage-crop``. In this way, you don't
need to specify in the ``GalleryWidget`` the param ``upload_url`` and ``fetch_url``,
and no need to specify the ``crop_url_name`` in each of the 3 class-based views.

Until now, we were talking about image model instance handling.


GalleryField rendering customization
--------------------------------------

Now we turn to the customization of gallery model.
Back to the demo, when dealing with the gallery model instance, there isn't much magic about
:class:`demo.views.GalleryCreateView` and :class:`demo.views.GalleryUpdateView`.
Here, we need to address :class:`demo.views.GalleryDetailView`, on how it rendering the
:class:`galleryfield.fields.GalleryField`.

With the ``MyImage`` in previous example as the ``target_model``, we can have a gallery model named ``MyGallery``:

.. snippet:: python
   :filename: my_app/models.py

   class MyGallery(models.Model):
        album = GalleryField(target_model="my_app.MyImage", verbose_name=_('My photos'))
        owner = models.ForeignKey(
                settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, null=False, blank=False,
                        verbose_name=_('Owner'), on_delete=models.CASCADE)


By subclassing :class:`django.views.generic.detail.DetailView`, we can have a gallery detail view like:

.. snippet:: python
   :filename: my_app/views.py

    from django.views.generic.detail import DetailView
    from my_app.models import MyGallery

    class MyGalleryDetailView(DetailView):
        model = MyGallery

Then we add a template file named ``mygallery_detail.html`` to folder ``my_app/templates/my_app/``,
with the following code block:

.. snippet:: html
   :filename: my_app/templates/my_app/mygallery_detail.html

    {% extends 'base.html' %}
    {% load static %}

    ...

    {% for obj in object.album.objects.all %}
        <img src="{{ obj.photo.url}}">
    {% endfor %}

    ...


And add the url of the view:

.. snippet:: python
   :filename: my_app/urls.py

    from my_apps import views

    urlpatterns = [
        ...
        path('album-detail/<int:pk>',
             views.MyGalleryDetailView.as_view(), name='my_gallery-detail'),
    ]

Then we can navigate to see the images in a specific gallery.

As you might guess from the first line in the template snippet,
the ``GalleryField`` provide a ``Queryset`` API for the image model
instances it related to. No wonder, you can do the following::

   >>> first_gallery = MyGallery.objects.first()
   >>> photos_in_first_gallery = first_gallery.album.objects.all()
   >>> photos_before_2021 = photos_in_first_gallery.filter(creation_time__lt=datetime(2021, 01, 01))


More over, the demo provide an  example of `how to render <https://github.com/dzhuang/django-galleryfield/blob/main/demo/templates/demo/demogallery_detail.html>`__
the field using ``sorl.thumbnail`` and ``Blueimp Gallery`` package.

Finally, it's your opportunity to show your skills on customizing the gallery/album frontend, which is beyond the scope of this package.
