    Equivalent to Sklearn CountVectorizer followed by DeltaTfidfTransformer.
    Parameters
    ----------
    input : {'filename', 'file', 'content'}, default='content'
        - If `'filename'`, the sequence passed as an argument to fit is
          expected to be a list of filenames that need reading to fetch
          the raw content to analyze.
        - If `'file'`, the sequence items must have a 'read' method (file-like
          object) that is called to fetch the bytes in memory.
        - If `'content'`, the input is expected to be a sequence of items that
          can be of type string or byte.
    encoding : str, default='utf-8'
        If bytes or files are given to analyze, this encoding is used to
        decode.
    decode_error : {'strict', 'ignore', 'replace'}, default='strict'
        Instruction on what to do if a byte sequence is given to analyze that
        contains characters not of the given `encoding`. By default, it is
        'strict', meaning that a UnicodeDecodeError will be raised. Other
        values are 'ignore' and 'replace'.
    strip_accents : {'ascii', 'unicode'}, default=None
        Remove accents and perform other character normalization
        during the preprocessing step.
        'ascii' is a fast method that only works on characters that have
        an direct ASCII mapping.
        'unicode' is a slightly slower method that works on any characters.
        None (default) does nothing.
        Both 'ascii' and 'unicode' use NFKD normalization from
        :func:`unicodedata.normalize`.
    lowercase : bool, default=True
        Convert all characters to lowercase before tokenizing.
    preprocessor : callable, default=None
        Override the preprocessing (string transformation) stage while
        preserving the tokenizing and n-grams generation steps.
        Only applies if ``analyzer is not callable``.
    tokenizer : callable, default=None
        Override the string tokenization step while preserving the
        preprocessing and n-grams generation steps.
        Only applies if ``analyzer == 'word'``.
    analyzer : {'word', 'char', 'char_wb'} or callable, default='word'
        Whether the feature should be made of word or character n-grams.
        Option 'char_wb' creates character n-grams only from text inside
        word boundaries; n-grams at the edges of words are padded with space.
        If a callable is passed it is used to extract the sequence of features
        out of the raw, unprocessed input.
    stop_words : {'english'}, list, default=None
        If a string, it is passed to _check_stop_list and the appropriate stop
        list is returned. 'english' is currently the only supported string
        value.
        There are several known issues with 'english' and you should
        consider an alternative.
        If a list, that list is assumed to contain stop words, all of which
        will be removed from the resulting tokens.
        Only applies if ``analyzer == 'word'``.
        If None, no stop words will be used. max_df can be set to a value
        in the range [0.7, 1.0) to automatically detect and filter stop
        words based on intra corpus document frequency of terms.
    token_pattern : str, default=r"(?u)\\b\\w\\w+\\b"
        Regular expression denoting what constitutes a "token", only used
        if ``analyzer == 'word'``. The default regexp selects tokens of 2
        or more alphanumeric characters (punctuation is completely ignored
        and always treated as a token separator).
        If there is a capturing group in token_pattern then the
        captured group content, not the entire match, becomes the token.
        At most one capturing group is permitted.
    ngram_range : tuple (min_n, max_n), default=(1, 1)
        The lower and upper boundary of the range of n-values for different
        n-grams to be extracted. All values of n such that min_n <= n <= max_n
        will be used. For example an ``ngram_range`` of ``(1, 1)`` means only
        unigrams, ``(1, 2)`` means unigrams and bigrams, and ``(2, 2)`` means
        only bigrams.
        Only applies if ``analyzer is not callable``.
    max_df : float or int, default=1.0
        When building the vocabulary ignore terms that have a document
        frequency strictly higher than the given threshold (corpus-specific
        stop words).
        If float in range [0.0, 1.0], the parameter represents a proportion of
        documents, integer absolute counts.
        This parameter is ignored if vocabulary is not None.
        This parameter is applied globally on the corpus,
        independent of class frequency.
    min_df : float or int, default=1
        When building the vocabulary ignore terms that have a document
        frequency strictly lower than the given threshold. This value is also
        called cut-off in the literature.
        If float in range of [0.0, 1.0], the parameter represents a proportion
        of documents, integer absolute counts.
        This parameter is ignored if vocabulary is not None.
        This parameter is applied globally on the corpus,
        independent of class frequency.
    max_features : int, default=None
        If not None, build a vocabulary that only consider the top
        max_features ordered by term frequency across the corpus.
        This parameter is ignored if vocabulary is not None.
        This parameter is applied globally on the corpus,
        independent of class frequency.
    vocabulary : Mapping or iterable, default=None
        Either a Mapping (e.g., a dict) where keys are terms and values are
        indices in the feature matrix, or an iterable over terms. If not
        given, a vocabulary is determined from the input documents.
    binary : bool, default=False
        If True, all non-zero term counts are set to 1. This does not mean
        outputs will have only 0/1 values, only that the tf term in tf-idf
        is binary. (Set idf and normalization to False to get 0/1 outputs).
    dtype : dtype, default=float64
        Type of the matrix returned by fit_transform() or transform().
    norm : {'l1', 'l2'}, default='l2'
        Each output row will have unit norm, either:
        - 'l2': Sum of squares of vector elements is 1. The cosine
          similarity between two vectors is their dot product when l2 norm has
          been applied.
        - 'l1': Sum of absolute values of vector elements is 1.
    use_idf : bool, default=True
        Enable inverse-document-frequency reweighting.
    smooth_idf : bool, default=True
        Smooth idf weights by adding one to document frequencies, as if an
        extra document was seen containing every term in the collection
        exactly once. Prevents zero divisions.
    sublinear_tf : bool, default=False
        Apply sublinear tf scaling, i.e. replace tf with 1 + log(tf).
    Attributes
    ----------
    vocabulary_ : dict
        A mapping of terms to feature indices.
    fixed_vocabulary_ : bool
        True if a fixed vocabulary of term to indices mapping
        is provided by the user.
    idf_ : array of shape (n_features,)
        The inverse document frequency (IDF) vector; only defined
        if ``use_idf`` is True.
    stop_words_ : set
        Terms that were ignored because they either:
          - occurred in too many documents (`max_df`)
          - occurred in too few documents (`min_df`)
          - were cut off by feature selection (`max_features`).
        This is only available if no vocabulary was given.
    Notes
    -----
    The ``stop_words_`` attribute can get large and increase the model size
    when pickling. This attribute is provided only for introspection and can
    be safely removed using delattr or set to None before pickling.
    Examples
    --------
    >>> from deltatfidf import DeltaTfidfVectorizer
    >>> corpus = [
    ... "I like cheese",
    ... "Cheese is the best",
    ... "I do not like cheese",
    ... "Cheese stinks"
    ... ]
    >>> labels = [0,0,1,1]
    >>> vectorizer = DeltaTfidfVectorizer()
    >>> X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus, labels)
    >>> vectorizer.get_feature_names()
    ['best', 'cheese', 'do', 'is', 'like', 'not', 'stinks', 'the']
