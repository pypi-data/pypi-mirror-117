several common characters are not allowed in JSON strings,
which means that they have to be escaped by backslashes,
e.g. `\"` and `\n`.
And since a backslash is used for escaping,
a literal backslash occurring in the text
(which is quite common in programming languages and markup languages)
has to be escaped itself (`\\`)."""))
# The JSON-based storage of this minimal notebook looks like this:
print(nbformat.writes(nb))
