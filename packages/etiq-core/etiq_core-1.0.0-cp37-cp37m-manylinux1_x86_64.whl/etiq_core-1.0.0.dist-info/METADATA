# ETQ AI

The ETIQ Engine helps teams who build machine learning models find and
mitigate negative biases at the earlier possible stage, before time and money is wasted training
a model on biased data. ETIQ helps companies avoid reputational threats, meet regulatory
requirements such as GDPR or discrimination laws and, more generally, build services appropriate
for a variety of groups in their consumer base.
