Websites are always changing, or going down, or banning ip's very quickly. In order to make sure this package stays reliable it is essential that it implements many websites

## Development
to install FreeProxyScraper, along with the tools you need to develop, run the following in the directory containing this repo:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]

If you'd like to contribute to development, right now the most needed thing is writing more plugins. In order to help, you need basic knowledge of BeautifulSoup4 and a little bit of patience with websites purposely making it hard for you to scrape information.
