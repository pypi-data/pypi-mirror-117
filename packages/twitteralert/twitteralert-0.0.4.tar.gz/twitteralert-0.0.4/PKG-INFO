# Twitter alert

Twitter alert is part of the twitter alert ecosystem that uses a custom
sqlite database and the access to the twitter platform through an API
to log and track a list of users and their activity in friendships
(aka users that one acount follows).

For each change detected within the resolution of the tracked data,
twitter alert makes a tweet (or prints into the console) the update.

## Quick start

To **install** the package you can either download it from pip or clone this
repository and install it locally.

```bash
# from pip
pip install twitteralert
```

Once installed, check that the installation was correct running 

```bash
$ talert info --version
Debug mode is off
twitteralert version: 0.0.1
```

Then, assuming that you already have a friends database from twitterobserver
(`friends.sqlite`) and a `secrets.json` file your API credentials for your twitter account
you can just run the following. 

```bash
talert friends -d friends.sqlite -S state.json -s secrets.json
```

**Note** that the  `state.json` file if not present
will be generated but containing the last query in the database. Thus, you
will need to run the tobserver again to generate a new query. You can also
potentially make a state file manually.

## Usage

The excutable contains multiple subcommands.

- `info` -> displays information such as the version of the package
- `friends` -> reports updates in the friendships from the selected users, it can also tweet them directly
