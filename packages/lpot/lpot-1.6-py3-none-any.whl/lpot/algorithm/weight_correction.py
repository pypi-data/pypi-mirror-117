    correct int8 weight distribution close to fp32 weight
    r*(W_int8 + u) -> W_fp32, r is variance ratio between fp32 and int8
    u is the difference between fp32 and int8 channel wise, it's equal to minimize:
    round(scale_c * (W_fp32 + shift))/scale - r*(round(scale * W_fp32) + scale*u)/scale
    notice we can only change the first round: round(scale_c * (W_fp32 + shift))
    an empirical solution is to make:
    scale_c = r * scale and shift = u
    with this we don't change the min/max value, and correct the weight
