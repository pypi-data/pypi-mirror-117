Description: # Murd
        Python Management of Matrix-like Key-Value store memories across disparate backends. Murd is the lowest level, pure python implementation backed by JSON. See [murdaws](gitlab.com/musingsole/murdaws) for AWS implementations.
        
        ## Data Model
        
        It is best to think of a Murd as a simple key-value store, but with a mysterious dark past utterly at odds with its outwardly waify-bookishness. Much like a goodly priest knowing too much about guns and the criminal underworld, Murds allow a few tricks for segmenting data and searching within those segments. Dirty tricks no JSON object was meant know.
        
        **Murd can be a footgun.** But used with a bit of cleverness for its keys and how to search them, Murds allow a network of distributed data stores backed by a variety of technologies including JSON, SQLite^, DynamoDB, and S3^.

        ### Open from file
        
        my_murd = Murd("/home/me/my_murd.json")
        
        ## Update
        
        murd.update([{"GROUP": "TEST": "SORT": "0": "DATA": 42}])
        
        ## Read
        
        murd.read(group='TEST')
        
        ## Delete
        
        murd.update([{"GROUP": "TEST": "SORT": "0": "DATA": 42}])
        
        ## Save to file
