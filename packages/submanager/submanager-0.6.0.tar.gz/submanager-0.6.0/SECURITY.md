## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've discovered a security vulnerability in Sub Manager, please contact the project maintainer, C.A.M. Gerlach, at CAM.Gerlach@r-SpaceX.com or CAM.Gerlach@Gerlach.CAM.
Please be sure to carefully document the vulnerability, including a summary, describing the impacts, identifying the line(s) of code affected, stating the conditions under which it is exploitable and including a minimal reproducible test case.
Further information and advice or patches on how to mitigate it is always welcome.
You can usually expect to hear back within 48 hours, at which point we'll inform you of our evaluation of the vulnerability and what steps we plan to take, and will reach out if we need further clarification from you.
Once its patched, we'll send a followup email letting you know, and are happy to update you on its status should you further inquire.
While this is a volunteer project and we don't have financial compensation to offer, we can certainly publicly thank you for your help if you would like, on the project and on the sub, as well as give you a special flair.
Thanks!
