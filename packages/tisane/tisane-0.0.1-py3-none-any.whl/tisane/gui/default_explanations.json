Therefore, a p-value of less than 0.05 is considered to reject the null hypothesis, i.e., the data does not seem to be normally distributed. P-values of more than or equal to 0.05 however do not mean that the data is definitely sampled from a normal distribution.

More similar in shape and more overlap, likely the better choice. **Caution:** A histogram of your dependent variable is *not* the same as the distribution of errors.

For example, if there are multiple observations from the same unit (i.e., repeated measures), data is hierarchical, or there are multiple ways to group observations that might overlap (i.e., non-nesting).
