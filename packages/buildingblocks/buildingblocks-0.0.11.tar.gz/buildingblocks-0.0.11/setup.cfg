long_description = Use *from buildingblocks import bb* and *bb.interpolate*. Xdata and Ydata are the first two arguments to the function *interpolate*. This (Xdata and Ydata) information is used to build a model and the third argument Xnew is the x-axis values of the interpolated data that the user wishes to have. The function returns Ynew for the given Xnew. The syntax is Ynew=interpolate(Xdata, Ydata, Xnew, iter), where *iter* is number of iterations given by the user (via trial and error)
