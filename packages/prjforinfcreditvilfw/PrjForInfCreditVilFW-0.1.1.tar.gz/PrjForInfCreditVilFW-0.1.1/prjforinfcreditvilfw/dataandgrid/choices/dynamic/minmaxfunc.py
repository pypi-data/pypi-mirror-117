    Situation 1:
        zero coh
        
        Borrow 10 dollar today
        tomorrow pay back 10(R) required
            
        if you use that money to invest in K, is that OK?
        not really, because K next period is only worth (1-d)K
        
        so you would owe 10R, and only have (1-d)10 if K == B
        
        so you would never borrow B to finance to finance K fully like this, not possible    
    
    Situation 2:
        supppose not every dollar of K' needs to be borrowed, you have some 
        income this period, some cash, non-zero cash from before. Could borrowing
        help?
        
        If you can not borrow, you invest whatever you think is optimal into K.
        any amount if ok for K, as long as you still have positive consumption. 
        so given you COH this period, the minimal K is 0 and the maximal K is spent
        bascially nearly every dollar on K.
        
        then now introduce savings. Savings is easy, if you want to do something
        other than K, you can plow some of your cash into savings as well, easy. 
        
        
        Now borrowing, if you borrow 1 dollar today, that changes the minimal K
        you need to save up, the 
        
            let's say coh: 10
            k min to max were: 0 to 10
            if you borrow $0.5, suppose R=2.0, massive 100 percent interest:
                k min = 1, need to have at least k=1 tomorrow to pay for 50 cents debt?
                    actually that is not even enough, because there is depreciation tomorrow, 
                        hence  0.5(1.0+1.0) = k(1-d), how much k is needed?
                            in other word if B=-1 (principle), how much k is needed
                                -B*(R)=K(1-d) 
                                -B * [(R)/(1-d)]
                what about k max ?
                k max is also now higher, you can have K_max = 10.5
                    would you do this?
                        you would, if capital is highly productive, and you normally invest 10.5
                        but this period you lacked some cash. 
                        
                    the ability to borrow in this world, would likely not impact
                    k 
                    
                    The key thing here, is that there are two different lines
                    one slope is for as borrowing increases, how much min k
                    is needed, this slope increases at a rate of:
                        For each B unit of principle, need to have this much K at least:                    
                            [(R)/(1-d)] > 1
                    the other slope is the slope is the top part of the slope, that
                        is as borrowing, increases, given each level of borrowing, what is:
                            for each B unit of principle acquired, have B unit of additional K' for investment.
                                the slope is 1. 
                                
                                so the question is, what is the peak point a the top left. 
                                
                                we start always at the 0,0 center point, at which point
                                we are consuming all cash on hand today. 
                                
                                ignoring the issues with fixed costs for a second:
                                
                                for borrowing:
                                
                                    the lower right = [0,   0]
                                    the upper right = [0, coh]
                                    
                                suppose there is no bound on how much could be borrowed:
                                    we have two lines, solve for where they intersect:
                                        
                                        top line:
                                            Y = coh - X
                                        bottom line:
                                            Y = 0 - ((R)/(1-d))*X                                            
                                        this is too simple, just says, they intersect if:
                                            coh - X_max = 0 - ((R)/(1-d))*X_max
                                            coh = X_max - ((R)/(1-d))*X_max
                                            coh = X_max * (1-((R)/(1-d)))

                        Think about how this works, so we have two assets:
                            1. one risky, one risk free, 
                            2. you are reducing the holding of the risk-free asset (when you borrow)
                                increasing the risky asset,
                            3. how much are you willing to do this?
                                especially given the particular constraint structure. 
                                
                                
                        
        
        
        would you be able to borrow? to help smooth consumption?
        is it better to borrow to smooth consumption, or is it better to use up
        your K?
