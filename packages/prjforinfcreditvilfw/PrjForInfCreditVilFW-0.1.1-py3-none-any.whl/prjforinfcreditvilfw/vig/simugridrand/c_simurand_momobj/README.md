Estimation is also simulation. First simulate over many initial points. Draw
points from random grid and simulate. Local and batch array.



Files such as those inside: C:\Users\fan\Documents\Dropbox (UH-ECON)\Project Dissertation\esti\c_20180925_ITG_list_Afx3_mlt_ne1a2
show in each subfolder the estimation results from starting with a particular estimation seed.

Folder: c_20180925_ITG_list_Afx3_mlt_ne1a2/C4E35M4S5_c21 represents the results from a particular Compute (C4), Estimate (E35), and Moment (4) and S? Structure, with the 21st starting seed for results based on "c_20180925_ITG_list_Afx3_mlt_ne1a2" model
simulation call.
