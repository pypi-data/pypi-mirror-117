> **LiDAR** (light detection and ranging) is a popular remote sensing mechanism used for measuring the exact distance of an object on the earth's surface. Since the introduction of GPS technology, it has become a widely used method for calculating accurate geospatial measurements. These geospatial data are used for different analysis purposes.
