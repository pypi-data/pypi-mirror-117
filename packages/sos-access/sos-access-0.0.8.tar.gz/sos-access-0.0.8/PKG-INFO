        ### Fixed
        
        * Fixed #17. newauthentication should be optional since it is not in the data when a 
          password change request was rejected due to wrong password
        
        ## 0.0.7 (2020-03-06)
        
        ### Fixed
        
        * Fixed #11. Error in docstring.
        * Fixed #10. additional_info on AlarmRequest as dict did not convert to string.
        * Fixed #12. Encoding error when sending to some alarm receives.
        
        ## 0.0.6 (2020-02-06)
        
        ### Fixed

        ### Changed
        
        * No exception logging in retry decorator since it creates noise in Sentry.
        
        ## 0.0.5 (2019-01-07)
        
        First client implementation ready for production use. Previous version was
        development versions and had some bugs in it. It still doesn't support all
        features but can be used without things breaking.
        Verified against SOS Alarm's alarm system.
