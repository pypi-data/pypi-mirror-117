The forge client has been reorganized under qcware.forge; for
every case where you would "import qcware" you should replace this
with "from qcware import forge" and then use "forge.optimization..."
"forge.qml..." etc.  Currently the old functionality is imported
into the "qcware" namespace for legacy compatibility, but this
compatibility will be removed in a future version.
