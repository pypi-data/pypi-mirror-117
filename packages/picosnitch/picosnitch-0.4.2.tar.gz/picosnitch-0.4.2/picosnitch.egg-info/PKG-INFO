Description: 
        # picosnitch
        - Monitors your system to notify you whenever a program makes its first remote network connection (while picosnitch has been running)
        - Or when the sha256 changes for one of these programs
        - Logs and config are stored in ~/.config/picosnitch/snitch.json
        - Inspired by programs such as:
          - GlassWire
          - Little Snitch
          - OpenSnitch
          - simplewall
          - tinysnitch
        - picosnitch only provides monitoring and notification capabilities, see the above programs for features such as a GUI, bandwidth tracking, firewall configuration, or filtering
        # getting started
        ## linux
        - install from PyPI with  
        `pip3 install picosnitch[full] --upgrade --user`
        - depends on the [BPF Compiler Collection](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/INSTALL.md)  
        `sudo apt install python3-bpfcc`
        - run daemon with  
        `picosnitch start`
        - stop daemon with  
        `picosnitch stop`
        ## windows
        - no longer supported for now, use a version <= v0.2.5
        ## building from source
        - install from source using python 3 with  
        `python setup.py install --user`
        - required dependencies (installed automatically from PyPI on setup if not already present)  
        `filelock plyer psutil python-daemon vt-py`
        - additional dependency (requires manual installation)  
        `bcc`
        - picosnitch.py can also be run directly
        # configuration
        - stored in ~/.config/picosnitch/snitch.json
        - terminate picosnitch if it is currently running before making any edits otherwise your changes will be lost

            "Log command lines": True, # Log command line args for each executable
            "Log remote address": True, # Log remote addresses for each executable
            "Only log connections": True, # Only log processes that make remote network connections
            # otherwise log every new process from exec()
            "Remote address unlog": [80, "chrome", "firefox"], # List of process names (str) or ports (int)
            # will omit connections that match any of these from the log of remote addresses to avoid clutter
            # the process and executable will still be logged if it has not been already

          },
          "Latest Entries": [], # Log of entries by time
          "Names": {}, # Log of processes by name containing respective executable(s)
          "Processes": {}, # Log of processes by executable containing:
          # cmdlines, days seen, first seen, last seen, name, ports, remote addresses, results
          # some cmdlines are consolidated using * as a wildcard
          "Remote Addresses": {} # Log of remote addresses containing respective executable(s)
        }
