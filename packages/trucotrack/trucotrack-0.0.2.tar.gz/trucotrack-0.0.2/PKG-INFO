# TrucoTrack - A Motion Capture Listener

TrucoTrack is a program intended to serve as a helper when using motion capture software (like MediaPipe). It defines a CSV file format for each of the available trackers and lets you easily call them from a command line.

## Warnings

Please take into account that this is an experimental software. It is still in development. Unfinished, unpolished, incomplete and probably, buggy. If you use it, please expect some inconsistencies and crashes.
