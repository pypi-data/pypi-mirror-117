Description: DataKund Scraper is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from any HTML page. You don't have to inspect any web elements to find tags, xpath id etc.
        It learns from the data given by you & builds a scraper. Then you can use it to get JSON data out of the HTML.
        
        ### Train Scraper
        We train scraper by passing two similiar htmls, which gives us a unique id. That id can be used for runing the scraper and fetching out data.
        You can save this id to run the scraper next time, so that you don't need to train the scraper everytime for that HTMLs.
        ```sh
        from datakund_ai_scraper import *
        html1='<html>.....</html>'
        html2='<html>.....</html>'
        response=scraper.parse(html1,html2)
        #response={"id":"esfdesd342","success":True}
        ```
        
        ### Run Scraper
        We run scraper by passing html and bot id which we fetched earlier and gives us a structured data in return.
        ```sh
        from datakund_ai_scraper import *
        html1='<html>.....</html>'
        response=scraper.run(html=html1,id="esfdesd342")
        #response={"Results":[{"title":"","link":""},...]}
        ```
        
        ### What are similiar HTMLs?
        Similiar htmls here refers to the web pages having same structure but different data. For example, pypi search results page for two different keywords.
        Once the scraper is trained over the pypi search results page, now you can pass any keyword's search results in run function without training on that page.
        Once trained on results page, you can run scraper over any pypi search results page.
        Below are some of the examples on which you can run autoscraper:-
        1. Pypi Search Results [https://pypi.org/search/?q=firebase,https://pypi.org/search/?q=sql]
        2. Amazon Search Results [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=shoes&ref=nb_sb_noss,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=shoes+for+men&crid=XSYZ3H3YZ2D7&sprefix=shoes%2Caps%2C474&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_5]
