        jmath is a hobby project developing a set of mathematical tools in the Python Language.
        
        ***
        ## Installation
        Open a terminal/command prompt and use `pip install jmath`.
        
        ***
        
        ## Documentation
        
        Documentation can be found at https://jordanhay.com/jmath
        
        ***
        ## Components
        
        ### Uncertainties
        Calculations with uncertain values.
        
        ### Linear Algebra
        Vector and Line mathematics with rudimentary planes introduced.
        
        ### Discrete
        Node, Graph, and Loop objects for use in Graph based maths.
        
        ### Physics (jmath.physics)
        Rudimentary classification of physical objects (jmath.physics.mechanics), circuits (jmath.physics.circuits), and SI prefixes (jmath.physics.prefixes).
        
        ### Approximation (jmath.approximation)
        Euler (jmath.approximation.euler_method) and Newton Method (jmath.approximation.newton_method) for approximation of Differential equations and Roots (respectively).
        
        ### Abstract (jmath.abstract)
        Provides implementations of abstract data types, including linked lists, stacks, queues, and dequeues.
        
        *** 
        ## Testing
        
        Open a terminal in the root director and run `pytest tests/`, this requires pytest. Tests are automatically run in Github by a Github Action.
        
        ***
        
        ## Github Workflows
        
        Github workflows help automate testing, updating the requirements, and publishing this repo.
