# French dictionaries from Laboratoire d'Automatique Documentaire et Linguistique (LADL)

## DESCRIPTION
This package contains several dictionaries processed from [one of those made available](https://infolingu.univ-mlv.fr/DonneesLinguistiques/Dictionnaires/telechargement.html)
by the former [Laboratoire d'Automatique Documentaire et Linguistique](https://infolingu.univ-mlv.fr/LADL/Historique.html) (LADL),
now integrated into [Institut Gaspard Monge](https://igm.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/) (IGM) of the [Université Gustave Eiffel](https://www.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/).

The selected dictionary is the inflected form DELA French dictionary in UTF-16 LE encoding, from March 16, 2006, with 683.824 simple entries for 102.073 different lemmas and 108.436 compounded entries for 83.604 different lemmas.

## HISTORY
DELA means "Dictionnaire Electronique du LADL" (LADL's electronic dictionaries). These dictionaries were initiated by the lab's founder, [Maurice Gross](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Gross).

This package of data files was originally intended to be used with the [PNU project](https://github.com/HubTou/PNU)'s
[conjuguer](https://github.com/HubTou/conjuguer) command, as well as many other text processing tools.

I wrote an [history of Unix & French dictionaries](https://github.com/HubTou/PNU/wiki/Les-dictionnaires-sous-Unix) (in French only),
which covers this dictionary and many others.
