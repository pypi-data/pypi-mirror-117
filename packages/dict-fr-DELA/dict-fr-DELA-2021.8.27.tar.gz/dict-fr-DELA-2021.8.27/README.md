## HISTORY
DELA means "Dictionnaire Electronique du LADL" (LADL's electronic dictionaries). These dictionaries were initiated by the lab's founder, [Maurice Gross](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Gross).

This package of data files was originally intended to be used with the [PNU project](https://github.com/HubTou/PNU)'s
[conjuguer](https://github.com/HubTou/conjuguer) command, as well as many other text processing tools.

I wrote an [history of Unix & French dictionaries](https://github.com/HubTou/PNU/wiki/Les-dictionnaires-sous-Unix) (in French only),
which covers this dictionary and many others.
