# üõ°Ô∏è Jupytery Auth

The `Jupytery Auth` library provides integrated authentication and autorization to [Jupyter Server](https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server).

It depends on a Jupyter Server [open draft WIP pull request](https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/pull/391).

## GitHub Auth

To use it with GitHub authentication, you need to create a [GitHub OAuth application](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-an-oauth-app) in your GitHub profile and export in your shell environment the GitHub client id and secret as the callback url as variable.

```bash
export GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<oauth-app-client-id>
export GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<oauth-app-client-secret>
export GITHUB_OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL=<oauth-calllback-url> # http://localhost:8686/example/login
```

Set the Callback URL to `http://localhost:8686/example/ogin`, assuming you are running the Jupyter Server on port 8686.
