# FreeProxyRevolver
This package provides implements requests library and automatically routes your requests through proxies, automatically revolving to the next proxy when requests become unsuccessful through it

## Installation
```shell
pip3 install FreeProxyRevolver
```

## Usage
```python
import FreeProxyRevolver

pr = FreeProxyRevolver.Revolver()

# Use just like requests
response = pr.get("http://example.com", min_anon_level=1)
print(response.content)

# This specifies to only use anonymous proxies or better, test that they're truly anonymous, and rotate proxies a maximum of 6 times before giving up on rotating for different response code
anon_pr = FreeProxyRevolver.Revolver(min_anon_level=1, max_rotates=6, test=True)
anon_response = anon_pr.get("http://example.com", min_anon_level=1)
print(anon_response.content)
```

You can also specify to use a fake user agent in requests like this: `pr.get("http://example.com", use_fake_ua=True)`. Websites will often block requests if there is not a user agent header, this will take care of that issue for you

`FreeProxyRevolver.Revolver()` also has a couple of parameters you can set in order to configure it. Here's a list of them all:

parameter         | purpose
------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
rotate_on_code    | A list of http response codes that should trigger a rotation of which proxy is used. Default: `[429, 403]`
rotate_not_on_code| A list of http response codes that should trigger a rotation of which proxy is used if the returned code is **not** on the list. Default: `[429, 403]`
max_rotates       | The maximum proxy rotations that should be tried before giving up on rotating proxies and just returning whatever was retrieved, regardless of response code. Default: `6`
min_anon_level    | Specifies the minimum anonymous level proxies used must meet. Level 0: transparent (server knows your ip), Level 1: Anonymous (server know you're using a proxy, but doesn't know your real ip.), Level 2: HIA/Elite (Server doesn't know your true ip or know that you are using a proxy). Default: `0`
test              | Specifies if proxies should be tested for if they leak your ip and claim to be anonymous.
