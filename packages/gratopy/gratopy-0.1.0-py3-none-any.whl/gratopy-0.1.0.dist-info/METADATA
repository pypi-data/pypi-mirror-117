The gratopy (**Gr**az **a**ccelerated **to**mographic projections for **Py**thon) toolbox is a Python3 software package for the efficient and high-quality computation of Radon transforms, fanbeam transforms as well as the associated backprojections. The included operators are based on pixel-driven projection methods which were shown to possess [favorable approximation properties](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/20M1326635). The toolbox offers a powerful parallel OpenCL/GPU implementation which admits high execution speed and allows for seamless integration into [PyOpenCL](https://documen.tician.de/pyopencl/). Gratopy can efficiently be combined with other PyOpenCL code and is well-suited for the development of iterative tomographic reconstruction approaches, in particular, for those involving optimization algorithms.

## Highlights
* Easy-to-use tomographic projection toolbox.
* High-quality 2D projection operators.
* Fast projection due to custom OpenCL/GPU implementation.
* Seamless integration into PyOpenCL.
* Basic iterative reconstruction schemes included (Landweber, CG, total variation).
* Comprehensive documentation, tests and example code.
