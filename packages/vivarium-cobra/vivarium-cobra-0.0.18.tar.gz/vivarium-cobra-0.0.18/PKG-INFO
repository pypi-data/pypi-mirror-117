Description: # Vivarium-COBRA
        
        A vivarium wrapper process for the COBRApy library.
        `COBRA_FBA` can be loaded with BiGG models, and has been primarily used with BiGG model iAF1260b. 
        The project includes `CobraComposite`, which adds auxiliary processes `MassDeriver` and `VolumeDeriver` 
        to make a type of dynamic FBA. Other processes can constrain individual fluxes in `COBRA_FBA` through 
        the flux_bounds port, allowing for a type of integrative FBA.
