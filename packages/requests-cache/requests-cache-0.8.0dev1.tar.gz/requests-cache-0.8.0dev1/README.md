## Summary
**requests-cache** is a transparent, persistent cache for the python [requests](http://python-requests.org)
library. It can substantially improve performance and reduce network traffic, making it an ideal
companion for almost any application using `requests`.

## Features
* üç∞ **Ease of use:** Use as a [drop-in replacement](https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#sessions)
  for `requests.Session`, or [install globally](https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide.html#patching)
  to add caching to all `requests` functions
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Customization:** Works out of the box with zero config, but with robust customization and
  extensibility so you can tailor it to your needs
* üöÄ **Performance:** With default settings, get sub-millisecond response times for cached responses
* üíæ **Persistence:** Works with several
  [storage backends](https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide.html#cache-backends),
  including SQLite, Redis, MongoDB, and DynamoDB; also includes
  [serializers](https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide.html#serializers)
  for storing responses as plain JSON files, YAML, and more
* üïó **Expiration:** Keep your cache fresh using
  [HTTP cache headers](https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide.html#cache-headers),
  eagerly cache everything for long-term use, use
  [URL patterns](https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide.html#url-patterns)
  for selective caching, or anything in between
* ‚úîÔ∏è **Compatibility:** Can be combined with
  [other popular libraries based on requests](https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced_usage.html#library-compatibility)

## Quickstart
First, install with pip:
```bash
pip install requests-cache
```

Then, use [requests_cache.CachedSession](https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#sessions)
to make your requests. It behaves like a normal
[requests.Session](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#session-objects),
but with caching behavior.

To illustrate, we'll call an endpoint that adds a delay of 1 second, simulating a slow or
rate-limited website.

**This takes 1 minute:**
```python
import requests

session = requests.Session()
for i in range(60):
    session.get('http://httpbin.org/delay/1')
```

**This takes 1 second:**
```python
import requests_cache

session = requests_cache.CachedSession('demo_cache')
for i in range(60):
    session.get('http://httpbin.org/delay/1')
```

With caching, the response will be fetched once, saved to `demo_cache.sqlite`, and subsequent
requests will return the cached response near-instantly.

If you don't want to manage a session object, or just want to quickly test it out in your application
without modifying any code, requests-cache can also be installed globally:
```python
requests_cache.install_cache('demo_cache')
requests.get('http://httpbin.org/delay/1')
```
