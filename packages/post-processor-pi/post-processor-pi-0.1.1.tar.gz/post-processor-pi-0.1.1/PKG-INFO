Description: **post-processor-pi** is a Python module that exploits the output of Document AI (tool available 
        on GCP) to create a JSON file that stores the text contained in a document in an organized way, so 
        that it reflects its original structure. To work with different types of 
        documents having different structures, post-processor-pi has to be configured using the GUI
        that I developed.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The easiest way to install post-processor-pi is using pip:
        
            pip install post-processor-pi
        
        Documentation
        ------------
        
        As I mentioned above in order to implement the post-processor we need to configure it first and this
        can be done using the Configuration GUI that I developed. 
        
        ### Configuration GUI 
        
        In order to start the Configuration GUI we need an example corresponding to the output of Document
        AI for one document. Below you can find the code example that enables you to start the Configuration
        GUI.
        
        ```python
        from dai_post_processor import post_processor as pp
        
        # Open one example from Document AI output
        path = "your/path/to/DocumentAI/example"
        doc_ai = pp.open_doc_ai(path)
        
        # Start Configuration GUI
        mywin = pp.configGUI(doc_ai)
        mywin.start()
        ```
        
        After running the above instructions the GUI should open.
        
        #### Configuration GUI Tuning
        
        The Configuration GUI consists of two windows:
        
        1) **Main**: here you can find the essential instructions that are needed to
         configure post-processor-pi.
            - **Select text of interest**: in this section you can select the portion
            of the pages in the documents you're interested in. In the **Page number** 
            field you can provide the page number of the Document example you want to open.
            I you press the **Draw Box** button a new window will open, and here you can
            select the portion of the page drawing a rectangle. All the text outside this
            rectangle will be ignored for all pages and documents. Once you performed the
            selection you can close the interactive window. Below you have a demo.

            - Structuring Filter: in this section you can specify the first and second
            level *points* that give structure to the document. In the 
            **Main Structure** field you need to 
            specify the regex rule that lets you find all the first level *points*. If
            you press the **Add Point** button an additional field, where you can specify
            the regex rule for the second level *points*, will appear.
            
            - Output: in this section you can specify what to include in the JSON output
            of the Post Processor. You can choose to include the list of all lines and
            paragraphs in the document and the structured text. You can also choose to 
            ignore those lines that are recognised as *Headers* with the Filter Headers
            checkbox.
         
        2) **Advanced**: here you can perform some more advanced configurations:
         
           - **Paragraph Multiplier**: Every line in the document that has a vertical
           gap with respect to the previous line lower than the median vertical gap of
           all lines in the document multiplied by the **Paragraph Multiplier**, will be
           appended to the previous line to form a paragraph.
