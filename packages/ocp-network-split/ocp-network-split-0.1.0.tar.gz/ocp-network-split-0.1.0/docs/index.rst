=========================
 OCP Network Split Setup
=========================

This simple project provides functionality to block (and unblock) network
traffic between `k8s zones`_ of an `OpenShift 4`_ cluster for *testing
purposes*, implemented by updating firewall rules on all RHEL CoreOS nodes of
the cluster.

This is useful when you need to separate network between given zones, without
affecting other traffic and with no assumptions about networking configuration
of the platform the cluster is deployed on (under normal conditions, network
separation like this could be done by tweaking network components between
zones).
