===================
 OCP Network Split
===================

Project ``ocp-network-split`` provides functionality to block (and unblock)
network traffic between `k8s zones`_, implemented by updating firewall rules on
all nodes of `OpenShift 4`_ cluster. The feature can be used either via command
line tools or a python module.

This is useful when you need to separate network between given zones for
*testing purposes*, without affecting other traffic and with no assumptions
about networking configuration of the platform the cluster is deployed on
(under normal conditions, network separation like this could be done by
tweaking network components between zones).
