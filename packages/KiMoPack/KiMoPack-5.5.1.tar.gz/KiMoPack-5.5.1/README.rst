KiMoPack
==========

KiMoPack is a project for the handling of spectral data measure at
multiple time-points. The current design is optimised for the use with
optical transient absorption data, but it has been successfully adapted
for the use with transient x-ray emission and spectro-electro chemistry
data.

It focuses on the main tasks an experimentator has
Loading and shaping of experiments, plotting of experiments, comparing of experiments,
analysing experiments with fast and/or advanced fitting routines and saving/exporting/presenting 
the results. 

For typical use a series of juypter notebooks are provided that guide 
through the a number of different use scenarios, and are suggesting the 
parameter that are typically set.
