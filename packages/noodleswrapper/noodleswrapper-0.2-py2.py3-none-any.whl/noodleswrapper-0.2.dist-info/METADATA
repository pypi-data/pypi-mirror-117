Noodles API wrapper
===================

A wrapper for [Noodles API](www.frenchnoodles.xyz/api) used as a meme generator and for welcome banners using the Discord interface.

Notices:
-------

* This module was designed for [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/ "discord.py PyPi page") 1.7+ but may work with older versions, use at your own risk however.

Installation:
-------------

###### Install with pip:
```
pip install noodleswrapper
```

Code examples:
-------------

###### Sample code with `lisastage` (Main file):
```
#Headers (Authentication) is optional.. for now.
import discord
from discord.ext import commands
import noodleswrapper #This is optional, assuming you've pip installed it, still worth to keep it though
from noodleswrapper import noodle

intents = discord.Intents.all() #Allow all the intents
client = commands.Bot(command_prefix = '!', intents=intents)

@client.command()
async def lisastage(ctx, *, text):
    pic = await noodle.lisastage('text') #'text' is what you want it to say
    try:
        await ctx.send(file = pic) #This should return a neat image. Note that a file is always returned so you need to send as a file.
    except: #If there's a ratelimit, the response will be sent as a string object
        await ctx.send(pic)
```

###### Sample code with `lisastage` (Cog):
```
#Headers (Authentication) is optional.. for now.
import discord
from discord.ext import commands
import noodleswrapper#This is optional, assuming you've pip installed it, still worth to keep it though
from noodleswrapper import noodle

class Noodle(commands.Cog):
    """Commands using Noodles wrapper."""

    def __init__(self, client):
      self.client = client

    @commands.command()
    async def worthless(self, ctx, *, message):
      text = await noodle.worthless(message) #'test' is what you want it to say
      try:
        await ctx.send(file = text) #This should return a neat image. Note that a file is always returned so you need to send as a file.
      except: #If there's a ratelimit, the response will be sent as a string object
        await ctx.send(text)

def setup(client):
  client.add_cog(Noodle(client)) #Must be the same as the class name
```
