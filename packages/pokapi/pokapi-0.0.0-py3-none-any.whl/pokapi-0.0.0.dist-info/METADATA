## Introduction

The [FOLIO](https://www.folio.org) platform is an [integrated library system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_library_system).  The Caltech Library uses a hosted solution by [EBSCO](https://www.ebsco.com) for its [library catalog](https://www.library.caltech.edu/libsearch).   To make writing interfaces and automation scripts in Python easier, the Caltech Library [Digital Library Development team](https://www.library.caltech.edu/staff?&field_directory_department%5B0%5D=754) developed Pokapi (_Python Okapi Interface_, a Python package that provides an object-oriented interface to accessing in a FOLIO instance via the [Okapi API](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/guide.md).


## Installation

The instructions below assume you have a Python interpreter installed on your computer; if that's not the case, please first [install Python version 3](INSTALL-Python3.md) and familiarize yourself with running Python programs on your system.

On **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows** operating systems, you should be able to install `pokapi` with [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).  To install `pokapi` from the [Python package repository (PyPI)](https://pypi.org), run the following command:
```
python3 -m pip install pokapi
```

As an alternative to getting it from [PyPI](https://pypi.org), you can use `pip` to install `pokapi` directly from GitHub, like this:
```sh
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/caltechlibrary/pokapi.git
```

Pokapi makes use of numerous open-source packages, without which Pokapi could not have been developed.  I want to acknowledge this debt.  In alphabetical order, the packages are:

* [commonpy](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/commonpy) &ndash; a collection of commonly-useful Python functions
* [ipdb](https://github.com/gotcha/ipdb) &ndash; the IPython debugger
* [setuptools](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools) &ndash; library for `setup.py`
* [sidetrack](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/sidetrack) &ndash; simple debug logging/tracing package
