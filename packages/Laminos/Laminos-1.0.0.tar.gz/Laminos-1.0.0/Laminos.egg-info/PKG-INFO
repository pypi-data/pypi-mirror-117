        #Wellcome gay & girl, As many people know, recently everyone faced a shutdown of bots by Team Amino.  We will make some changes to the existence of 1.2.17 and re-release our amino share in a remaster.  Let's start !!
        
        #As everyone already knows, to install the lib, you need to register a command. pip install amino.py
        
        #Installation of this lib is quite simple!  To do this, you just need to write _/
        
        #pip install Laminos
        
        #Completely!
