# and "problems".

#     problems = an instance of ``toolbox.Problems`` that manages
#                a basic history of the problems found.
#
# info::
#     This class uses the attribut ``success`` to indicate if
#     at least one "critical" or error has been emitted (sometimes
#     we want to continue to work even if something bad has been
#     found, for example when working on several projects in the
#     same monorepo)

#     a warning that blocks one part of the process but not all the process.
