pyconversations.reader
======================

.. testsetup::

    from pyconversations.reader import *

The `pyconversation.reader` sub-module contains Classes which can read from disk into a universal, conversation format.
While the `ConvoReader` can and should be used (especially post-conversion into the universal format),
other readers are provided as examples of how to augment the basic function of a reader to get it to read other
file formats one might have from an API.
