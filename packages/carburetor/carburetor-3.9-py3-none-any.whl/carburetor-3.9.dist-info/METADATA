    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tractor-team/tractor
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install carburetor

If you are using a distro other than Ubuntu, please check if the release name in the relevant file located in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` is a supported one (e.g. bionic).

If your distro is not Debian based or you don't want to use PPA, just copy `carburetor` file to `/usr/bin/` directory, but note that you will miss the updates and many desktop features. However you are welcome in contributing package build recepie of your distro to carburetor.

## Run
