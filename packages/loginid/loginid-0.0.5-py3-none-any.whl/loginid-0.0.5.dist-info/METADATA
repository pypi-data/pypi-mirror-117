# LoginID Python SDK

## About 

LoginID’s server SDK enables websites and apps to utilize FIDO2 certified strong customer authentication, including the ability to provide more sensitive operations such as credential management. By leveraging the end user’s existing device biometrics or however the device is unlocked (e.g. PIN for Windows Hello), you can quickly integrate multi-factor authentication into your site. LoginID also offers [Transaction Confirmation](https://docs.loginid.io/Guides/Flows/tx-conf-guide/), where a transaction can be cryptographically signed providing proof of the user’s confirmation of that specific transaction, which is perfect for online merchants or FIs looking for secure payment authentication. Our service is aligned with PSD2, GDPR, CCPA, and HIPPA. The server SDK to connect with LoginID's infrastructure
