        # LASSO BBN
        
        Learning Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) with LASSO. Example code is as below. 
        
        ```python
        import pandas as pd
        from lassobbn.learn import do_learn
        
        df = pd.read_csv('./path/to/data.csv')
        bbn_specs = do_learn(df)
        
        print(bbn_specs)
        ```
        
        You can then use [Py-BBN](https://py-bbn.readthedocs.io/) to create a BBN and join tree (JT) instance and perform exact inference.
