banner.Connection(self, host, user, passwd=None, db=None, ssl_key=None, ssl_cert=None, name=None):
    Create connection object compatible with banner.queries

banner.connections(conns: Dict[str, Connection] = {}):
    Getter/Setter for known connections dict

banner.simple_query(query: str, connection=None, as_df=True) -> pd.DataFrame:
    run a simple string query for connection, return data as list of dicts / df
    for connection=None try to get first known connection

banner.neware_query(device: int, unit: int, channel: int, test: int, connection: Union[Connection, str] = None, raw=False):
    query connection for device, unit, channel, test
    raises Value err if no data exists
    for raw=True return data as saved in the db
    for raw=False compute temp, voltage, current aswell as grouping by auxchl_id 
    for connection=None try to get first known connection

banner.neware_query_by_test(table: str, cell: int, test: int, connection: Union[Connection, str] = None, raw=False):
    query connection for device, unit, channel, test, as well as the connection storing the data
    raises Value err if no data exists
    ** the connection has to be an entry in connections() **
    returns neware_query for result values
    for connection=None try to get first known connection
