# ⚛️ Jupytery React

> Jupytery React, React.js for Jupyter.

This folder curates techniques to use [React.js](https://reactjs.org) inside the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) ecosystem, with a primary focus on wrapping [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) components into a React.js DOM tree. The JupyterLab UI is built on the [Lumino](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino) widgets.

Please open [Issues](https://github.com/datalayer/datalayer/issues) for questions, feature requests, bug reports... We also welcome [Pull Requests](https://github.com/datalayer/datalayer/pulls).

You can find more details on the [documentation website](https://docs.datalayer.io/docs/jupyter/react).

## Develop

You can launch a local storybook and hack the source code. The changes will be automatically built and displayed in your browser.

[![lumino-in-react](./docs/images/lumino-in-react.png)](https://jupytery-react.datalayer.io)

```bash
# Setup your development environment.
conda deactivate && \
  make env-rm # If you want to reset your env.
make env && \
  conda activate jupytery-react
```

```bash
# Clean, install and build.
make clean
make install
make build
```

```bash
# Start the storybook.
echo open http://localhost:9005
make storybook
# To execute code from the storybook, start a separated jupyterlab server.
make jupyterlab
```

To build a static storybook website, run `yarn build-storybook`. The generated website will be available under the `storybook/.out` folder.

```bash
yarn build-storybook && \
  open storybook/.out/index.html
```

To deep clean your local repository, run `make clean`.

## Examples

```bash
# Start a Lumino example.
echo open http://localhost:8080
yarn example:lumino
```

```bash
# Start a JupyterLab React example.
echo open http://localhost:8080
yarn example:jupyter:widgets
```

## Deploy

You can deploy the storybook in your [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (former Now.js) account. 

Test the build on your local environment.

```bash
# This will open storybook/.out/index.html in your browser.
make storybook-build
```

Ccnfigure a vercel `datalayer-jupyter-storybook` project with:

- Build command: `yarn build:vercel`
- Output directory: `storybook/.out`.

Then run the following command to deploy in production.

```bash 
# Deploy the storybook (if you have karma for).
# open https://datalayer-jupyter.datalayer.io
make storybook-prod
```
