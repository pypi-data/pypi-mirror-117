# gff3_parser

This is a simple python package to parse [gff3](http://gmod.org/wiki/GFF3) ( Generic Feature Format) 
files into pandas dataframes. This file format is used for genetic annotation files and I couldn't find a parser
that worked with python so I wrote this. This is still a work in progress and I'll hopefully be adding 
features soon.

This whole project has literally one public function so far so I'm just going to document it here until
I feel like it needs more.
