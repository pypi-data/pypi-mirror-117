        ## What is it?
        
        Functions to measure the height of optically thick emission, or photosphere, using the method presented in [Pinte et al. (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...609A..47P/abstract), then use this information to reproject images into arbitrary angles. Very much a work in progress.
        
        ## How do I install it?
        
        Currently the only way to install this is by cloning the repository then installing a local version.
        
        ```
        $ git clone https://github.com/richteague/disksurf.git
        $ cd diskprojection
        $ pip install .
        ```
        
        This has a couple of dependencies, namely [astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy) and [GoFish](https://github.com/richteague/gofish), which should be installed automatically if you don't have them.
        
        ## How do I use it?
        
        A more comprehensive document will be coming soon.
        
        #### Notes
        
        Part of the code uses `detect_peaks.py` from [Marcos Duarte](https://github.com/demotu/BMC).
