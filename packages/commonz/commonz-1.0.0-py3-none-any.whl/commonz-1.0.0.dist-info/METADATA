There is already many python modules,  

But i think some are wrong, and should not be used,  

or they have a lot of confusing options.  

Thats the reason for me to write modules wrapping what i need.  

Then instead of looking again and again what should i use and how to use it correctly, i just go into my own modules.  

Also making these modules independent of projects allows to share the upgrades and bug fix more easily.





## üìù Note

 - The modules are written for Python3 and no effort are made for compatibility with Python2.

 - The modules are only tested on Linux O.S.  hoping to be able to work on other platforms.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Special thanks

I am very grateful for all those modules that i use in my own modules,  

of course i respect their license, and would like to push these people on top,  

Because without them im not much.
