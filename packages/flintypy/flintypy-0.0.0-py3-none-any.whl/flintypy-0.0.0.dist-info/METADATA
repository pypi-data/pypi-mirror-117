# Flexible and Interpretable Non-parametric Tests of Exchangeability

This package allows the user to test whether their multivariate dataset is exchangeable, given specified dependencies between the features. It can also test for exchangeability given only a list of pairwise distances between individuals. This is the work of Aw, Spence and Song (2021).
