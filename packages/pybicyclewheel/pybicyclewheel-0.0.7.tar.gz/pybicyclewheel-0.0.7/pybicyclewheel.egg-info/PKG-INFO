## remark

the calculation methods mentioned above differ sligthly from each other by putting e.g. spoke hole, or spoke radius
into consideration or not. 
the provided method within this module uses a mathematic 3d geometric vector and matrix based approach
to determine the length of a spoke using [`numpy`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy). 


# how to use

maintain your rim and hub data in the xls sheets provided in the github repo

- [hub data xls](https://github.com/kr-g/pybicyclewheel/blob/main/hubs.xls)
- [rim data xls](https://github.com/kr-g/pybicyclewheel/blob/main/rims.xls)


call the [`simple gui`](https://github.com/kr-g/pybicyclewheel/tree/main/pybicyclewheel_gui)
with (remark: hubs.xls, and rims.xls base dir is "~/Downloads")

    python3 -m pybicyclewheel_gui
    
    
or use it along with [`sample.py`](https://github.com/kr-g/pybicyclewheel/blob/main/sample.py).


alternatively explore [`xls_calc.py`](https://github.com/kr-g/pybicyclewheel/blob/main/pybicyclewheel/xls_calc.py)
and use the classes directly (less convinient).


probably a better user interface (then the simple one) will be provided later ... (if i have time i will do)
